Simulation of "Infection Spreading on a Square Grid", written in python and inspired from Béla Bollobás book: "The Art of Mathematics, (2006)". With the help of the BinderHub environment (https://mybinder.org), our repository can be turnrned out into an executable interactive application.
To run it just click the binder logo "launch binder":
[![Spreading Infection on a Square Grid](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xsources/Epidemic-Speading-of-Information-and-Ideas/master).
After the binder server being launched, you can run either the spreading application either by clicking the link "spreading_algorithm_and_code.ipynb" that runs algorithm and code step by step (notebook cell by cell) or "full.ipynb" to run the full code. Once the file open, click on the Jupyter Run button in the page menu to run the interactive spreading.
After the application being displayed, click "Next spread" button to compute and show the parameters of the epidemic spreading. Click the "Reset" button to reset the current process and start a new spreading process.
