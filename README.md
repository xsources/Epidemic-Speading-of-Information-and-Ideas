Simulation of "Infection Spreading on Square Grid", written in python and inspired from Béla Bollobás book: "The Art of Mathematics, (2006)". With the help of the BinderHub environment (https://mybinder.org), our repository can be turnrned out into an executable interactive application.
To run it just click the binder logo "launch binder":
[![Spreading Infection on a Square Grid](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xsources/Epidemic-Speading-of-Information-and-Ideas/master).
After the binder server being launched, you can run either the spreading application either by clicking the link "spreading_algorithm_and_code.ipynb" or "full.ipynb". Once the file open, click on the Jupyter Run button in the page menu to run the interactive spreading.
