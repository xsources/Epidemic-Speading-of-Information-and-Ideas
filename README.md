Simulation of "Infection Spreading on a Square Grid", written in python and inspired from Béla Bollobás book: "The Art of Mathematics, (2006)". With the help of the BinderHub environment (https://mybinder.org), our repository can be turned out into an executable interactive application.
To run it just click the binder logo "launch binder":
[![Spreading Infection on a Square Grid](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/xsources/Epidemic-Speading-of-Information-and-Ideas/master).
After the binder server being launched, you can run the spreading application either by clicking the link "spreading_algorithm_and_code.ipynb" that runs algorithm and code step by step (notebook cell by cell) or "full.ipynb" to run the full code. Once the file open, click on the Jupyter Run button in the page menu to run the interactive spreading.

Three types of distribution are suggested for the whole infection of the grid.

-Random infection.

-Diagonal infection

-Two-sides infection

Choose one from the three distributions by uncommenting the appropriate block and by disabling (commenting) the others.
After the application being displayed, click "Next spread" button to compute and show the parameters of the epidemic spreading. Click the "Reset" button to reset the current process and start a new spreading process.

This repository is the simulation part of my Medium post, entitled [Epidemic spreading of Information and ideas. Simulation on a square grid](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/epidemic-spreading-of-information-and-ideas-simulation-on-a-square-grid-9825a91c37b7)
